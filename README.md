# Weather App

In this project I used the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data for cities. The app has a search facility which the user provides the name of the city to forecast and the current weather data along with 5 day future forecast is given. For saving the city to the search history localStorage was used. The weathed data includes temperature, humidity, UV index and wind speed.

Below is the snapshot of the project.
